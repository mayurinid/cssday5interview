<h3>4.What are CSS Combinators?</h3>
<p>Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS combinator selectors are as follows.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Descendant Selector (space)</li>
    <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
    <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</li>
    <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Descendant Selector :  The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
    <p>Child Selector :   The child selector will only affect elements under a direct parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct parents.</p>
    <p>Adjacent Sibling Selector :   To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
    <p>General Sibling Selectors :The general sibling selector follows through on all elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow through.</p>
    <h3>5.What are CSS Pseudo Selectors?</h3>
    <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", </p>
